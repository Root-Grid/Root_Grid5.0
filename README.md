# Blockchain-based Loyalty and Rewards Program

## Overview

This project was developed as part of Flipkart's Grid5.0 hackathon. The objective was to create a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program for E-commerce platforms, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and user engagement. The system generates fungible tokens as loyalty points on the blockchain, allowing users to earn rewards based on various actions, such as purchases, referrals, or social media interactions.

## Features

- Generate fungible tokens as loyalty points on the blockchain.
- Define tokenomics, including token value and issuance rules.
- Efficient account settlement/reconciliation process between Brands and E-commerce platforms.
- Rules for earning fungible tokens based on user actions.
- Reward issuance by platform partners and sellers.
- Transparent and secure distribution of tokens to customers' digital wallets.
- User-friendly interface for managing loyalty points, viewing rewards, and tracking progress.
- Recording of all token-related transactions on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- Blockchain: The project utilizes the Polygon blockchain to deploy the solution.
- Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are written in Solidity.
- Frontend: The frontend is built using Next.js (React.js).
- Backend: Node.js / Expess.js is used for the backend.
- Database: MongoDB is used to store user and transaction data.
